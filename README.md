A Baseline-Relative, Non-Diagnostic Architecture for Mental Health Stability Monitoring

Author: James Teutschman

Status: Public Defensive Disclosure 


1. Technical Field

This disclosure relates to human-centered monitoring systems and, more specifically, to non-diagnostic architectures for detecting stability drift in complex human systems while preserving user agency and ethical constraints.


2. Background

Conventional mental health technologies are primarily organized around:
-diagnosis
-prediction
-risk stratification
-behavioral optimization
These approaches typically rely on:
-population-derived norms
-opaque inference
-escalating interventions triggered by threshold crossings
Such systems frequently introduce harm through:
-misclassification
-loss of agency
-coercive escalation
-monetization of distress
There exists a need for a system that detects change without diagnosing, supports early awareness without enforcing behavior, and reduces suffering without reducing dignity.


3. Summary of the Architecture

This disclosure describes a preventive maintenance architecture for mental health stability that:
-monitors changes relative to an individual’s own historical baseline
-detects drift, strain, and instability as system properties
-surfaces such changes without assigning clinical labels, risk scores, or predictions
The system is architecturally incapable of:
-diagnosing mental illness
-predicting future behavior
-acting as a clinical decision authority
Ethical constraints described herein are not implementation choices but structural requirements. Any system that violates these constraints is not an extension of this architecture, regardless of technical similarity. The novelty of this architecture lies in the combination of baseline-relative monitoring, non-diagnostic operation, user-preauthorized response pathways, and structurally enforced ethical exclusions.


4. Core Architectural Principles (Invariant)

4.1 Baseline-Relative Monitoring
All measurements are computed relative to the individual’s own historical patterns.
The system explicitly excludes:
-population averages
-normative targets
-externally imposed ideals
The architecture does not define what a person should be; it only detects what is changing over time.

4.2 Non-Diagnostic Operation
The system does not:
-identify mental illness
-assign clinical labels
-determine medical conditions
-generate treatment plans
-assert diagnostic or predictive certainty
Outputs describe system state trends, not pathology or identity.
Terms such as “stable,” “drifting,” or “strained” denote observed behavioral variance, not character, effort, intent, or worth.

4.3 Drift Detection as a System Property
Instability is treated as an emergent property of interacting signals over time.
no single signal is sufficient to trigger system state transitions
detected drift reflects direction, persistence, and variance of change
severity judgments are explicitly excluded

4.4 Human Judgment Supremacy
The system does not make decisions on behalf of users or clinicians.
It does not:
-recommend treatment
-enforce action
-override choice
-initiate escalation independently
All responses occur through user-defined preferences or voluntary human involvement.
Automation may assist awareness but never assumes responsibility.


5. Signal Constraints and Data Use

5.1 Permitted Inputs
Only minimal metadata necessary for detecting stability drift may be used, including:
-timing
-magnitude
-variance

5.2 Explicit Exclusions
The system explicitly excludes:
-analysis of message content
-conversations
-audio
-video
-sentiment analysis
-private communications
-covert behavioral inference
All data use must be:
-transparent
-user-known
-revocable


6. User Agency and Control (Structural)

Participation is voluntary.
Users retain the ability to:
-pause or stop monitoring
-review and delete data
-understand how signals are interpreted
-define how and when responses occur
No hidden logic, undisclosed data use, or non-consensual escalation is permitted within this architecture.


7. Explicitly Prohibited Uses

7.1 Classification or Scoring of People
This architecture must not be used to generate:
-mental health risk scores
-rankings
-comparative wellness metrics
-hidden classifications or profiles
People are not units to be sorted.

7.2 Gating Access or Opportunity
Outputs must never be used to influence:
-employment decisions
-insurance eligibility or pricing
-housing access
-education placement
-legal judgments
-eligibility for benefits or services

7.3 Behavioral Control or Coercion
The system must not be used to:
-compel action
-mandate routines
-penalize deviation
-pressure disclosure
-override personal judgment
Support must remain supportive, not corrective.

7.4 Fear-Based Engagement or Monetization
The system must not:
-exaggerate risk to drive engagement
-use alarming language to retain users
-upsell services during periods of instability
-monetize distress, anxiety, or vulnerability
-target advertising based on mental state
Any business model dependent on distress is incompatible with this architecture.

7.5 Autonomous Clinical Authority
The system must not:
-initiate emergency responses without consent (except where legally required outside this framework)
-replace professional assessment
-generate treatment plans
-act as a diagnostic authority


8. On Misrepresentation

Any system that:
-claims diagnostic capability
-asserts predictive certainty
-obscures its logic
-removes user control
while referencing or resembling this architecture, constitutes a misrepresentation of the work described herein.
Ethical alignment is a defining feature, not an optional compatibility layer.


9. Closing Statement

This architecture is designed for people as they are, not as idealized subjects.
instability is not failure
drift is not weakness
needing support is not a defect
The purpose of this system is to make earlier, quieter, lower-harm care possible.
Its success is not measured by engagement, optimization, or growth, but by the number of crises that never occur.
